### Part - 3 : What is ASP.NET MVC? | ASP.NET MVC

In ASP.NET MVC, MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. A model is used as a data signature to interact with the database, a view is what the users sees and a controller is a C# class responsible for the application logic. ASP.NET MVC is a great framework to easily separate the application concerns.

When you create an empty ASP.NET MVC project in Visual Studio it comes with some default folders and files.
On this part you will learn about empty MVC project structure.

### Part - 6 : Course code structure | ASP.NET MVC

All the code for this course can be found in this GITHUB (https://github.com/etrupja/complete-e...)  repository.

### Part - 7 : Application models overview | ASP.NET MVC

A model is used as a blueprint of data in a database (SQL, MySQL, etc.) and for each feature, you generally need at least one model. But, what are the main models of our app?

### Part - 8 : Adding your first model | ASP.NET MVC

Models are just C# classes that serve as blueprints of data that you want to store or get from the database.

### Part - 9 : Adding producer model | ASP.NET MVC

The producer model will be used as the model class to interact with the database for producer-related data. You will use it to add producers to the database, get producers, update producers and even remove producers from the database.

### Part - 10 : Adding cinema model | ASP.NET MVC

The cinema model will be used as the model class to interact with the database for cinema-related data. You will use it to add cinemas to the database, get cinemas, update cinemas and even remove cinemas from the database.

### Part - 11 : Adding movie model | ASP.NET MVC

The movie model will be used as the model class to interact with the database for movie-related data. You will use it to add movies to the database, get movies, update movies and even remove movies from the database.
This model is the most important model of the application.

### Part - 12 : Adding your DbContext file | ASP.NET MVC

The DbContext file is also known as the translator file between the Models (C# classes) and the data storage (SQL in our case).

You can create your custom DbContext by inheriting from the DbContext base class and configure your class to be used to translate C# code into SQL and vice versa.

### Part - 13 : Adding model relationship | ASP.NET MVC

Model relationships are used to define table relationships in your database (SQL in our case).
There are 3 relationship types, one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many. 

### Part - 14 : Configuring SQL Server | ASP.NET MVC

In this course, you will use SQL Server as your data storage. But, for the AppDbContext to know about your data storage you need to configure it in the Startup.cs file. 

### Part - 15 : Adding your first migration | ASP.NET MVC

#Migrations are used to sync your model changes with your database schema. But, which library should you install? How is a migration created and applied in the database?

### Part - 16 : Seeding your database | ASP.NET MVC

Database seeding is a way to add some dummy data to your database to get started. But, how can you seed your database with data using entity framework core?
