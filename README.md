### Part - 26 : Designing the Movie card | ASP.NET MVC

The Movies view is the most important view, but in the last part, we just used a simple list. In this part, you will design the Movie card which is the actual design that will be used in this app.

### Part - 27 : Designing the navigation bar | ASP.NET MVC

In this part, you will learn how to design the navigation part so it includes all the features/options that we have added so far. 
The navigation bar will include options to navigate to movies, which is the most important view, but also a dropdown for cinemas, actors, and producers.

### Part - 28 : Adding IActorsService interface | ASP.NET MVC

So far in our ASP.NET MVC application, we have injected the AppDbContext file directly into the controller which is not a good practice.
You are going to remove the data-related code from the controllers and use services instead. You are going to start with the ActorsService and the first step is to create the IActorsService interface. Interfaces will be used to inject in the controllers, so this way we are adding one more layer of abstraction into our app.

### Part - 29 : Adding your first service | ASP.NET MVC

In this part, you will add your first service to the ASP.NET MVC application. Bu adding services we have removed the data-related code in the controllers and injecting services instead of the AppDbContext file. 

### Part - 30 : Major dependency-injection lifetimes (Singleton vs Scoped vs Transient) | ASP.NET MVC

ASP.NET MVC supports the dependency injection (DI) software design pattern, which is a technique for achieving Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies.
There are multiple dependency injection methods that you can use, but on this part, you will learn about the three main ones: Singleton, Scoped, and Transient.
